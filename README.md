# About Me
My name is Allison Miao, and I use she/her/her pronouns. I am currently a graduate student in the Business Intelligence & Data Analytics pathway of the Information Systems Management program at Carnegie Mellon University. This advanced program is designed to deepen my understanding and enhance my skills in managing and analyzing data, preparing me to solve complex information systems problems in the business world.

My journey began with my undergraduate studies at The Ohio State University, where I earned my degree in Business Economics from the Fisher College of Business. This foundational education provided me with a solid understanding of economic principles and their application to business strategies and operations.

I am eager to leverage my background and ongoing education to contribute to and learn from dynamic teams focused on innovation and strategic data use. I look forward to connecting with professionals and exploring opportunities where I can apply my skills and grow professionally.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn: [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allison-yuhan-miao/)

## What I hope to learn
My goal is to master the techniques of translating complex data sets into clear and compelling visual stories that can influence decision-making and strategic thinking. 

Upon graduating, I plan to pursue a career where I can provide these capabilities, ideally as a product manager, consultant, or data analyst. Each of these roles requires a unique blend of analytical skills and creative thinking.
