# About Me
My name is Allison Miao, and I use she/her/her pronouns. I am currently a graduate student in the Business Intelligence & Data Analytics pathway of the Information Systems Management program at Carnegie Mellon University. This advanced program is designed to deepen my understanding and enhance my skills in managing and analyzing data, preparing me to solve complex information systems problems in the business world.

My journey began with my undergraduate studies at The Ohio State University, where I earned my degree in Business Economics from the Fisher College of Business. This foundational education provided me with a solid understanding of economic principles and their application to business strategies and operations.

I am eager to leverage my background and ongoing education to contribute to and learn from dynamic teams focused on innovation and strategic data use. I look forward to connecting with professionals and exploring opportunities where I can apply my skills and grow professionally.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn: [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allison-yuhan-miao/)

## What I hope to learn
My goal is to master the techniques of translating complex data sets into clear and compelling visual stories that can influence decision-making and strategic thinking. 

Upon graduating, I plan to pursue a career where I can provide these capabilities, ideally as a product manager, consultant, or data analyst. Each of these roles requires a unique blend of analytical skills and creative thinking.

### Government Debt Visualization

![export-2024-09-10T21_36_07 653Z](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fc6e0be-999e-48d8-aa41-323941564a1d)

The bar graph displayed here, sourced from the OECD, visualizes the general government debt as a percentage of GDP for various countries in the year 2022. It highlights the significant variation in debt levels across different nations, with Japan showing the highest ratio, significantly above other countries. This metric represents the total gross debt of a country's government relative to its GDP. Tracking this ratio could assess the sustainability of government finances, as it reflects the cumulative impact of government deficits over time.

This heat map, sourced from the OECD, illustrates the evolution of national debt-to-GDP ratios for a selection of countries from 1995 to 2019. Each cell represents the ratio for a particular country in a given year. The color coding of the map distinguishes between debt-to-GDP ratios below and above 100%. Ratios below 100% are represented in shades of blue, where darker blues indicate lower debt levels relative to GDP, and lighter blues are closer to 100%. Conversely, ratios above 100% are shown in shades of orange, with darker oranges representing higher debt levels and lighter oranges nearing 100%. This visual representation shows how government debt levels have changed over time in response to economic conditions, policy decisions, and other factors, and helps understand the fiscal health and sustainability of government finances across these nations.

This line graph, sourced from the OECD, illustrates the trend of national debt-to-GDP ratios for selected countries from 1995 to 2019. It tracks the fiscal metrics of Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Japan, and the United States, each represented by a distinct color. The graph highlights significant trends and shifts in debt levels relative to GDP and compares how each country's debt situation has evolved over the specified period.

**Summary**
The three visualization methods present national debt-to-GDP ratios by offering unique insights into fiscal dynamics. The bar graph captures a straightforward comparison of countries at a single point in time. In contrast, the second method, the heat map, spans from 1995 to 2019, using color gradients to indicate fluctuations over time, with blue shades representing ratios below 100% and orange for those above. This visualization effectively highlights trends and periods of fiscal change across a broader set of countries.

The line graph traces the specific debt trajectories of six countries over the same period, offering a dynamic view of how debt levels have evolved in response to economic policies and global events. I chose to do this visualization because it analyzes the impact of fiscal decisions and economic crises on national debt levels.
