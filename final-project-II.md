# Part II: Final project wireframes/storyboards and user research

Final Project Overview

**The Relationship Between Video Game Quality and Sales Across Genres, Platforms, and Regions**

**Introduction**: Video game success can be measured both by critical reception and sales performance. However, how do these metrics align across different genres, platforms, and regions? Are highly-rated games always the top sellers, or do certain regions or platforms prioritize different aspects of gaming?
